# 🧠 Easy Algorithms Guide

A complete step-by-step roadmap to mastering algorithms and data structures — made simple and practical by solving real problems (LeetCode, Codeforces, Quera, ...)

---

## 📌 What Is This?

This repository is built to **teach you algorithms the easy and smart way**:
- 📚 **Topic guides** that explain the “why” behind every concept  
- 🧩 **Hand-picked problems** to sharpen your skills  
- ✅ **Line-by-line explained solutions** to learn from real code  
- 📈 **Progressive difficulty**: each folder's questions get harder as you go

Follow the structured path, one folder at a time.

---

## 🚀 How to Use This Guide

1. Begin each topic with the `lesson.md` file to understand the concepts.
2. Solve the problems in order — each number increases in difficulty.
3. Stuck? Read the `explanation.md` to clarify the approach.
4. Then, refer to the annotated solution (`annotated.cpp`) or clean version (`source.cpp`).
